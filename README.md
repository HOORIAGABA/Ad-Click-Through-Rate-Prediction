# Ad Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the click-through rate (CTR) of ads in the entertainment sector using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Accurate CTR prediction is essential for optimizing ad campaigns, improving targeting, and ultimately maximizing revenue. By leveraging user interaction data, ad attributes, and contextual information, this project aims to build a model that captures the complexities of user behavior to deliver relevant ads effectively.

## Problem Statement
Predicting ad CTR is a challenging task due to:
1. **Data Sparsity**: Limited user interactions with ads can lead to data sparsity, making it difficult to discern robust patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and engineering relevant features is critical for accuracy, given the complex and nonlinear relationships in user behavior.

## Goals and Objectives
1. Develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression or XGBoost to forecast CTR.
2. Gain insights into key features that influence ad CTR to support data-driven decisions.
3. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance comprehensively, demonstrating its relevance to the digital advertising industry.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collect and preprocess data, focusing on cleaning and transforming ad interaction data to ensure accuracy.
   - Engineer features that reflect the impact of ad content, user demographics, browsing history, and other contextual factors.
   
2. **Model Development**
   - Train initial models using Logistic Regression and XGBoost, assessing performance and adjusting hyperparameters for accuracy.
   - Use cross-validation and metrics like precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.

3. **Feature Analysis and Insights**
   - Analyze feature importance scores to understand the drivers of ad CTR.
   - Derive actionable insights that can inform ad placement, targeting, and bidding strategies.

4. **Deployment and Recommendations**
   - Package the final model for integration into ad-serving systems.
   - Generate recommendations for campaign optimization based on model findings.

## Expected Outcomes
- A machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the click-through rate of entertainment ads.
- Insightful analysis of key CTR-driving features, supporting targeted and optimized ad strategies.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, XGBoost
